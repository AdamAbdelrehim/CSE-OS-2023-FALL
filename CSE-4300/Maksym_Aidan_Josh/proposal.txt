We plan on implementing the Multi-Level Feedback Queue, FIFO, SJF, and SRTCF CPU schedulers in OS161. 
Tests will be written to compare the performance of each scheduler to that of the existing OS161 scheduler (Round Robin).
The Round Robin scheduler in OS161 may not be optimal for all workloads. Thus, we will implement the other schedulers to improve performance in various cases.
