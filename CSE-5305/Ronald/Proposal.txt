Synchronization Testing

  The main goal of my project is to test the overhead costs of various synchronization mechanisms. These include atomic variables, spin lock, mutex, semaphore, and conditional variables.
I also plan to compare these using an example program. Lastly, I plan to see how the number of threads impacts the run time of the example program, and how this changes if there are more
threads than cores.
