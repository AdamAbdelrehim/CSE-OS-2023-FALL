The project I am proposing is a multi-threaded binary puzzle solver. The Program takes in a string of 0's and 1's, 36 integers long, and outputs a 36 integer-long string detailing a correct solution to the input. The program will create a parent thread, which will, in turn, create children threads which will input a random guess, either 0 or 1, and will attempt to determine if the solution is viable or not. Once a solution is found, all threads will be terminated, and the solution will be returned.
