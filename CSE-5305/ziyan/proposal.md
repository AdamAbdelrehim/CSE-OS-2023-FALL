# Project Proposal: Deploying vHive Serverless Platform and Running Benchmarks

## Project Overview
We propose a project to deploy and benchmark the vHive serverless platform. vHive is designed to enable serverless systems researchers to innovate within the complex and distributed software stacks of modern serverless platforms. It integrates production-grade components used by leading Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) providers, including the AWS Firecracker hypervisor, Cloud Native Computing Foundation's Containers, and Kubernetes.

vHive adopts the Knative flexible programming model, allowing researchers to quickly deploy and experiment with various serverless applications comprising multiple functions and stateful services. These applications run in secure Firecracker microVMs and can be deployed using OCI/Docker images. vHive empowers researchers to innovate on key serverless features, such as function autoscaling and cold-start delay optimization, utilizing various snapshotting mechanisms.

Moreover, vHive incorporates support for state-of-the-art extensions like eStargz for container layers and lazy pull support for container images, further enhancing its capabilities.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Deploy vHive Serverless Platform: Set up the vHive serverless platform in a controlled environment, ensuring all the necessary components, including AWS Firecracker, Containerd, and Kubernetes, are properly configured and integrated.

2. Benchmark vHive: Conduct a series of benchmark tests to evaluate the performance and capabilities of vHive. This includes assessing key serverless features like function autoscaling, cold-start delay optimization, and snapshotting mechanisms.

3. Analyze Results: Carefully analyze the benchmark results to identify strengths and weaknesses of vHive. Understand how it compares to other serverless platforms and determine its suitability for different use cases.

4. Documentation: Document the deployment process, benchmarking methodologies, and results in a comprehensive report. Provide detailed instructions for reproducing the deployment and benchmarks.

## Methodology
To achieve the project objectives, we will follow these steps:

1. Infrastructure Setup: Provision a dedicated infrastructure environment for deploying vHive, ensuring it closely resembles a production environment. This may include setting up virtual machines, configuring networking, and installing required software components.

2. vHive Deployment: Install and configure vHive on the prepared infrastructure. Verify that all components, including the AWS Firecracker hypervisor, Containerd, and Kubernetes, are functioning correctly.

3. Benchmarking: Design a suite of benchmark tests that stress-test vHive in various scenarios. These tests should cover aspects such as function autoscaling, cold-start delays, and snapshotting mechanisms. Run the benchmarks under controlled conditions to collect meaningful data.

4. Data Collection: Gather benchmarking data, including response times, resource utilization, and scalability metrics. Ensure that the tests provide a comprehensive overview of vHive's performance.

5. Analysis: Analyze the benchmark results to identify bottlenecks, performance optimizations, and areas of improvement within vHive. Compare the results with industry benchmarks and similar serverless platforms.

6. Reporting: Create a detailed project report that includes the deployment process, benchmarking methodologies, and results. Present findings, insights, and recommendations for further research or improvements.
